/*
 * PGRAPH registers of interest, NV50
 *
 * 0x400040: disables subunits of PGRAPH. or at least disables access to them
 *           through MMIO. each bit corresponds to a unit, and the full mask
 *           is 0x7fffff. writing 1 to a given bit disables the unit, 0
 *           enables.
 * 0x400300: some sort of status register... shows 0xe when execution stopped,
 *           0xX3 when running or paused.
 * 0x400304: control register. For writes:
 *           bit 0: start execution
 *           bit 1: resume execution
 *           bit 4: pause execution
 *           For reads:
 *           bit 0: prog running or paused
 * 0x400308: Next opcode to execute, or the exit opcode if program exitted.
 * 0x40030c: RO alias of PC for some reason
 * 0x400310: PC. Readable and writable. In units of single insns.
 * 0x40031c: the scratch register, written by opcode 2, holding params to
 *           various stuff.
 * 0x400320: WO, CMD register. Writing here launches a cmd, see below.
 * 0x400324: code upload index, WO. selects address to write in ctxprog code,
 *           counted in whole insns.
 * 0x400328: code upload, WO. writes given insn to code segment and
 *           autoincrements upload address.
 * 0x40032c: current channel RAMIN address, shifted right by 12 bits. bit 31 == valid
 * 0x400330: next channel RAMIN address, shifted right by 12 bits. bit 31 == valid
 * 0x400334: $r register, offset in RAMIN context to read/write with opcode 1.
 *           in units of 32-bit words.
 * 0x400338: Some register, set with opcode 3. Used on NVAx with values 0-9 to
 *           select TP number to read/write with G[0x8000]. Maybe generic
 *           PGRAPH offset? Also set to 0x8ffff in one place for some reason.
 * 0x40033c: Some other register. Set with opcode 0x600007. Related to and
 *           modified by opcode 8. Setting with opcode 0x600007 always ands
 *           contents with 0xffff8 for some reason.
 * 0x400784: channel RAMIN address used for memory reads/writes. needs to be
 *           flushed with CMD 4 after it's changed.
 * 0x400824: Flags, 0x00-0x1f, RW
 * 0x400828: Flags, 0x20-0x3f, RW
 * 0x40082c: Flags, 0x40-0x5f, RO... this is some sort of hardware status
 * 0x400830: Flags, 0x60-0x7f, RW
 *
 * How execution works:
 *
 * Execution can be in one of 3 states: stopped, running, and paused.
 * Initially, it's stopped. The only way to start execution is to poke 0x400304
 * with bit 0 set. When you do this, the uc starts executing opcodes from
 * current PC. The only way to stop execution is to use CMD 0xc.
 * Note that CMD 0xc resets PC to 0, so ctxprog will start over from there
 * next time, unless you poke PC before that. Running <-> paused transition
 * happens by poking 0x400304 with the appropriate bit set to 1. Poking with
 * *both* bits set to 1 causes it to reload the opcode register from current
 * PC, but nothing else happens. This can be used to read the code segment.
 * Poking with bits 4 and 0 set together causes it to start with paused state.
 *
 * Oh, also, PC has 9 valid bits. So you can have ctxprogs of max. 512 insns.
 *
 * CMD: These are some special operations that can be launched either from
 * host by poking the CMD number to 0x400320, or by ctxprog by running opcode
 * 6 with the CMD number in its immediate field. See tabcmd.
