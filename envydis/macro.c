/*
 * The Fermi PGRAPH MACRO ISA.
 *
 * Code space is 0x800 32-bit words long and part of PGRAPH context. Code
 * addresses are counted in 32-bit words.  The MACRO unit sits between PFIFO
 * and PGRAPH_DISPATCH. It processes the following methods:
 *
 *  - 0x114: set upload address [in words]
 *  - 0x118: upload a single word of code to current upload index, increment
 *           the index
 *  - 0x11c: set binding macro index
 *  - 0x120: bind macro specified by 0x11c to code starting at given address
 *  - 0x3800+i*8: launch macro #i [XXX: check range]
 *  - 0x3804+i*8: send an extra param
 *  - any other: pass through to DISPATCH unchanged
 *
 * There are 8 GPRs, $r0-$r7, $r0 is hardwired to 0. $r1 is set on launch to
 * the data sent to the 0x3800+i*8 method that caused the launch. There's
 * a carry flag for adc and sbb opcodes.
 *
 * The state also includes "current method address" and "current method
 * increment". They're both set using various "maddr" ops as listed below -
 * bits 0-11 of operand are shifted left by 2 and become the method address,
 * bits 12-17 are shifted left by 2 and become the increment. Other bits
 * are ignored. A "send" op sends a method specified by the current address
 * with the param used as data, then increments current address by current
 * increment.
 *
 * A macro is also allowed to submit method reads. This is done by using
 * the read op. The operand's bits 0-11 are shifted left by 2 and used as
 * method address to read.
 *
 * A macro can also pull extra parameters by the "parm" op and its variations.
 * "parm" will wait until a 0x3804+i*8 method is submitted from PFIFO and load
 * its data to the destination. If an unconsumed parameter remains after macro
 * exits, or if a non-3804 method is submitted while macro is waiting for
 * a parameter, a trap occurs.
 *
 * As for flow control, there are branch on zero / non-zero instructions, and
 * every instruction can be marked with the "exit" modifier which causes the
 * macro to end. Normal branches and "exit" have delay slots - they don't
 * actually take effect until the next instruction finishes. Branches also
 * have "annul" variants which don't have delay slots. Combining "exit" with
 * a branch is a special case: the exit happens if and only if the branch
 * is not taken. It's an error to use a branch in a delay slot.
 *
 * Stuff marked SC below is not actually a separate instruction, just
 * a special case of a more generic insn.
