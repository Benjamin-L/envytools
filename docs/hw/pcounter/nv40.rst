Introduction
============

NV40 generation cards have the following counter domains:

- NV40 generation cards without turbocache:

  - 0: host clock
  - 1: core clock [PGRAPH front]
  - 2: geometry[?] clock [PGRAPH back]
  - 3: shader clock
  - 4: memory clock

- NV40 generation with turbocache that are not IGPs:

  - 0: host clock
  - 1: core clock [PGRAPH front]
  - 2: shader clock
  - 3: memory clock

- NV40 IGP:

  - 0: host clock
  - 1: core clock [PGRAPH probably]
  - 2: core clock [shaders probably]
  - 3: unknown, could be the memory interface
