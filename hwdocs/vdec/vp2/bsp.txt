= Introduction =

The BSP is the first stage of the VP2 decoding pipeline. It is part of
PBSP and deals with decoding the H.264 bitstream into syntax elements.

The input to the BSP is the raw H.264 bitstream. The output of BSP is MBRING,
a ring buffer structure storing the decoded syntax elements in the form
of word-aligned packets.

The BSP only deals with parsing the NALs containing the slice data - the
remaining NAL types are supposed to be parsed by the host. Further, the
hardware can only parse pred_weight_table and slice_data elements efficiently
 - the remaining parts of the slice NAL are supposed to be parsed by the
firmware controlling the BSP in a semi-manual manner: the BSP provides
commands that parse single syntax elements.

The following H.264 profiles are supported:
 - Constrained Baseline
 - Baseline [only in single-macroblock mode if FMO used - see below]
 - Main
 - Progressive High
 - High
 - Multiview High
 - Stereo High

The limitations are:
 - max picture width and height: 128 macroblocks [XXX: or 255?]
 - max macroblocks in picture: 8192

There are two modes of operation that BSP can be used with: single-macroblock
mode and whole-slice mode. In the single-macroblock mode, parsing for each
macroblock has to be manually triggered by the firmware. In whole-slice mode,
the firmware triggers processing of a whole slice, and the hardware
automatically iterates over all macroblocks in the slice. However, whole-slice
mode doesn't support Flexible Macroblock Ordering aka. slice groups. Thus,
single-macroblock mode has to be used for sequences with non-zero value of
num_slice_groups_minus1.

The BSP keeps extensive hidden internal state, including:
 - pred_weight_table data, to be prepended to the next emitted macroblock
 - bitstream position, zero byte count [for escaping], and lookahead buffer
 - CABAC valMPS, pStateIdx, codIOFfset, codIRange state
 - previously decoded parts of macroblock data, used for CABAC and CAVLC
   context selection algorithms
 - already queued but not yet written MBRING output data


= The registers =

The BSP registers are located in PBSP XLMI space at addresses 0x00000:0x08000
[BAR0 addresses 0x103000:0x103200]. They are:

00000:02000/103000:103080 - BSP control registers
00000/103000: PARM_0 - parameters from sequence/picture parameter structs and
                       the slice header
00100/103004: PARM_1 - parameters from sequence/picture parameter structs and
                       the slice header
00200/103008: MB_POS - position of the current macroblock
00300/10300c: COMMAND - writing executes a BSP command
00400/103010: STATUS - shows busy status of various parts of the BSP
00500/103014: RESULT - result of a command
00700/10301c: INTR_EN - interrupt enable mask
00800/103020: ??? [XXX]
00900/103024: INTR - interrupt status
00a00/103028: RESET - resets the BSP and its registers to initial state
01000+i*0x100/103040+i*4, 0<=i<8: CONF[i] - length and enable bit of
						   stream buffer i
01100+i*0x100/103044+i*4, 0<=i<8: OFFSET[i] - offset of stream buffer i
02000/103080: BITPOS - the bit position in the stream
04000/103100: OFFSET - the MBRING offset
04100/103104: HALT_POS - the MBRING halt position
04200/103108: WRITE_POS - the MBRING write position
04300/10310c: SIZE - the MBRING size
04400/103110: TRIGGER - writing executes MBRING commands


= Reset =

The engine may be reset at any time by poking the RESET register.

BAR0 0x103028 / XLMI 0x00a00: RESET
  Any write will cause the BSP to be reset. All internal state is reset to
  default values. All user-writable registers are set to 0, except UNK8
  which is set to 0xffffffff.


= Parameter and position registers =

The values of these registers are used by some of the BSP commands. PARM
registers should be initialised with values derived from sequence parameters,
picture parameters, and slice header. MB_POS should be set to the address of
currently processed macroblock [for single-macroblock operation] or the first
macroblock of the slice [for whole-slice operation]. In whole-slice operation,
MB_POS is updated by the hardware to the position of the last macroblock in
the parsed slice.

For details on use of this information by specific commands, see their
documentation.

BAR0 0x103000 / XLMI 0x00000: PARM_0
  bit 0: entropy_coding_mode_flag - set as in picture parameters
  bits 1-8: width_mbs - set to pic_width_in_mbs_minus1 + 1
  bit 9: mbaff_frame_flag - set to (mb_adaptive_frame_field_flag && !field_pic_flag)
  bits 10-11: picture_structure - one of:
    0: frame - set if !field_pic_flag
    1: top field - set if field_pic_flag && !bottom_field_flag
    2: bottom field - set if field_pic_flag && bottom_field_flag
  bits 12-16: nal_unit_type - set as in the slice NAL header [XXX: check]
  bit 17: constrained_intra_pred - set as in picture parameters [XXX: check]
  bits 18-19: cabac_init_idc - set as in slice header, for P and B slices
  bits 20-21: chroma_format_idc - if parsing auxiliary coded picture, set to 0,
    otherwise set as in sequence parameters
  bit 22: direct_8x8_inference_flag - set as in sequence parameters
  bit 23: transform_8x8_mode_flag - set as in picture parameters

BAR0 0x103004 / XLMI 0x00100: PARM_1
  bits 0-1: slice_type - set as in slice header
  bits 2-14: slice_tag - used to tag macroblocks in internal state with their
    slices, for determining availability status in CABAC/CAVLC context
    selection algorithms. See command description.
  bits 15-19: num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 - set as in slice header, for P
    and B slices
  bits 20-24: num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 - set as in slice header, for B
    slices
  bits 25-30: sliceqpy - set to (pic_init_qp_minus26 + 26 + slice_qp_delta)

BAR0 0x103008 / XLMI 0x00200: MB_POS
  bits 0-12: addr - address of the macroblock
  bits 13-20: x - x coordinate of the macroblock in macroblock units
  bits 21-28: y - y coordinate of the macroblock in macroblock units
  bit 29: first - 1 if the described macroblock is the first macroblock in its
    slice, 0 otherwise


= Internal state for context selection =

Both CAVLC and CABAC sometimes use decoded data of previous macroblocks in the
slice to determine the decoding algorithm for syntax elements of the current
macroblock. The BSP thus stores this data in its internal hidden memory.

[XXX: what macroblocks are stored, indexing, tagging, reset state]

For each macroblock, the following data is stored:
 - slice_tag
 - mb_field_decoding_flag
 - mb_skip_flag
 - mb_type
 - coded_block_pattern
 - transform_size_8x8_flag
 - intra_chroma_pred_mode
 - ref_idx_lX[i]
 - mvd_lX[i][j]
 - coded_block_flag for each block
 - total_coeffs for each luma 4x4 / luma AC block
[XXX: and availability status?]

Additionally, the following data of the previous decoded macroblock [not
indexed by macroblock address] is stored:
 - mb_qp_delta

[XXX: write me]


= Command and status registers =

[XXX: write me]


== Command 0: GET_UE ==

Parameter: none
Result: the decoded value of parsed bitfield, or 0xffffffff if out of range

Parses one ue(v) element as defined in H.264 spec. Only elements in range
0..0xfffe [up to 31 bits in the bitstream] are supported by this command.
If the next bits of the bitstream are a valid ue(v) element in supported
range, the element is parsed, the bitstream pointer advances past it, and
its parsed value is returned as the result. Otherwise, bitstream pointer
is not modified and 0xffffffff is returned.

Operation:
	if (nextbits(16) != 0) {
		int bitcnt = 0;
		while (getbits(1) == 0)
			bitcnt++;
		return (1 << bitcnt) - 1 + getbits(bitcnt);
	} else {
		return 0xffffffff;
	}


== Command 1: GET_SE ==

Parameter: none
Result: the decoded value of parsed bitfield, or 0x80000000 if out of range

Parses one se(v) element as defined in H.264 spec. Only elements in range
-0x7fff..0x7fff [up to 31 bits in the bitstream] are supported by this command.
If the next bits of the bitstream are a valid se(v) element in supported
range, the element is parsed, the bitstream pointer advances past it, and
its parsed value is returned as the result. Otherwise, bitstream pointer
is not modified and 0x80000000 is returned.

Operation:
	if (nextbits(16) != 0) {
		int bitcnt = 0;
		while (getbits(1) == 0)
			bitcnt++;
		int tmp = (1 << bitcnt) - 1 + getbits(bitcnt);
		if (tmp & 1)
			return (tmp+1) >> 1;
		else
			return -(tmp >> 1);
	} else {
		return 0x80000000;
	}


== Command 2: GETBITS ==

Parameter: number of bits to read, or 0 to read 32 bits [5 bits]
Result: the bits from the bitstream

Given parameter n, returns the next (n?n:32) bits from the bitstream as an
unsigned integer.

Operation:
	return getbits(n?n:32);


== Command 3: NEXT_START_CODE ==

Parameter: none
Result: the next start code found

Skips bytes in the raw bitstream until the start code [00 00 01] is found.
Then, read the byte after the start code and return it as the result. The
bitstream pointer is advanced to point after the returned byte.

Operation:
	byte_align();
	while (nextbytes_raw(3) != 1)
		getbits_raw(8);
	getbits_raw(24);
	return getbits_raw(8);


== Command 4: CABAC_START ==

Parameter: none
Result: none

Skips bits in the bitstream until the current bit position is byte-aligned,
then initialises the arithmetic decoding engine registers codIRange and
codIOffset, as per H.264.9.3.1.2.

Oprtation:
	byte_align();
	cabac_init_engine();


== Command 5: MORE_RBSP_DATA ==

Parameter: none
Result: 1 if there's more data in RBSP, 0 otherwise

Returns 0 if there's a valid RBSP trailing bits element at the current bit
position, 1 otherwise. Does not modify the bitstream pointer.

Operation:
	return more_rbsp_data();


== Command 6: MB_SKIP_FLAG ==

Parameter: none
Result: value of parsed mb_skip_flag

Parses the CABAC mb_skip_flag element. The SLICE_POS has to be set to the
address of the macroblock to which this element applies.

Operation:
	return cabac_mb_skip_flag();


== Command 7: END_OF_SLICE_FLAG ==

Parameter: none
Result: value of parsed end_of_slice_flag

Parses the CABAC end_of_slice_flag element.

Operation:
	return cabac_terminate();


== Command 8: CABAC_INIT_CTX ==

Parameter: none
Result: none

Initialises the CABAC context variables, as per H.264.9.3.1.1. slice_type,
cabac_init_idc [for P/B slices], and sliceqpy have to be set in the PARM
registers for this command to work properly.

Operation:
	cabac_init_ctx();


== Command 9: MACROBLOCK_SKIP_MBFDF ==

Parameter: mb_field_decoding_flag presence [1 bit]
Result: none

If parameter is 1, mb_field_decoding_flag syntax element is parsed. Otherwise,
the value of mb_field_decoding_flag is inferred from preceding macroblocks.
A skipped macroblock with thus determined value of mb_field_decoding_flag
is emitted into the MBRING, and its data stored into internal state. SLICE_POS
has to be set to the address of this macroblock.

Operation:
	if (param) {
		if (entropy_coding_mode_flag)
			this_mb.mb_field_decoding_flag = cabac_mb_field_decoding_flag();
		else
			this_mb.mb_field_decoding_flag = getbits(1);

	[XXX: more inferred crap]
	mbring_emit_macroblock();


== Command 0xa: MACROBLOCK_LAYER_MBFDF ==

Parameter: mb_field_decoding_flag presence [1 bit]
Result: none

If parameter is 1, mb_field_decoding_flag syntax element is parsed. Otherwise,
the value of mb_field_decoding_flag is inferred from preceding macroblocks.
A macroblock_layer syntax structure is parsed from the bitstream, data for the
decoded macroblock is emitted into the MBRING, and stored into internal state.
SLICE_POS has to be set to the address of this macroblock.

Operation:
	if (param) {
		if (entropy_coding_mode_flag)
			this_mb.mb_field_decoding_flag = cabac_mb_field_decoding_flag();
		else
			this_mb.mb_field_decoding_flag = getbits(1);
	} else {

	}
	this_mb.mb_skip_flag = 0;
	this_mb.slice_tag = slice_tag;
	macroblock_layer();


== Command 0xb: PRED_WEIGHT_TABLE ==

Parameter: none
Result: none

Parses the pred_weight_table element, stores its contents in internal memory,
and advances the bitstream to the end of the element.

Operation:
	XXX


== Command 0xc: SLICE_DATA ==

Parameter: none
Result: none

Writes the stored pred_weight_table data to MBRING, parses the slice_data
element, storing decoded data into MBRING, halting when the RBSP trailing bit
sequence is encountered. When done, raises the MACROBLOCKS_DONE interrupt.
Bitstream pointer is updated to point to the RBSP traling bits. SLICE_POS has
to be set to the address of the first macroblock on slice before this command
is called. When this command finishes, SLICE_POS is updated to the address of
the last macroblock in the parsed slice.

Operation:
	if (entropy_coding_mode_flag) {
		cabac_init_ctx();
		byte_align();
		cabac_init_engine();
	}
