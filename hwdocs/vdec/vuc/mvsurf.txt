= Introduction =

H.264, VC-1 and MPEG4 all support "direct" prediction mode where the forward
and backward motion vectors for a macroblock are calculated from co-located
motion vector from the reference picture and relative ordering of the
pictures. To implement it in vµc, intermediate storage of motion vectors and
some related data is required. This storage is called MVSURF.

A single MVSURF object stores data for a single frame, or for two fields. Each
macroblock takes 0x40 bytes in the MVSURF. The macroblocks in MVSURF are
first grouped into macroblock pairs, just like in H.264 MBAFF frames. If the
MVSURF corresponds to a single field, one macroblock of each pair is just left
unused. The pairs are then stored in the MVSURF ordered first by X coordinate,
then by Y coordinate, with no gaps.

The vµc has two MVSURF access ports: MVSURF_IN for reading the MVSURF of
a reference picture [first picture in L1 list for H.264, the most recent I
or P picture for VC-1 and MPEG4], MVSURF_OUT for writing the MVSURF of the
current picture. Usage of both ports is optional - if there's no reason to
use one of them [MVSURF_IN in non-B picture, or MVSURF_OUT in non-reference
picture], it can just be ignored.

Both MVSURF_IN and MVSURF_OUT have to be set up via MMIO registers before use.
To write data to MVSURF_OUT, it first has to be stored by the vµc into MVSO[]
memory space, then the mvswrite instruction executed [while making sure the
previous mvswrite instruction, if any, has already completed]. Reading
MVSURF_IN is done by executing the mvsread instruction, waiting for its
completion, then reading the MVSI[] memory space [or letting it be read
implicitly by the vµc fixed-function hardware].

Note that MVSURF_OUT writes in units of macroblocks, while NVSURF_IN reads in
units of macroblock pairs - see details below.

A single MVSURF entry, corresponding to a single macroblock, consists of:

 - for the whole macroblock:
   - frame/field flag [1 bit]: for H.264, 1 if mb_field_decoding_flag set or
     in a field picture; for MPEG4, 1 if field-predicted macroblock
   - inter/intra flag [1 bit]: 1 for intra macroblocks
 - for each partition:
   - RPI [5 bits]: the persistent id of the reference picture used for this
     subpartition and the top/bottom field selector, if applicable - same as
     the $rpil0/$rpil1 value.
 - for each subpartition of each partition:
   - X component of motion vector [14 bits]
   - Y component of motion vector [12 bits]
   - zero flag [1 bit]: set if both components of motion vector are in -1..1
     range and refIdx [not RPI] is 0 - partial term used in H.264 colZeroFlag
     computation

For H.264, the RPI and motion vector are from the partition's L0 prediction
if present, L1 otherwise. Since vµc was originally designed for H.264,
a macroblock is always considered to be made of 4 partitions, which in turn
are made of 4 subpartitions each - if macroblock is more coarsely
subdivided, each piece of data is duplicated for all covered 8x8 partitions
and 4x4 subpartitions. Partitions and subpartitions are indexed in the same
way as for $spidx.


= MVSURF format =

A single macroblock is represented by 0x10 32-bit LE words in MVSURF. Each
word has the following format [i refers to word index, 0-15]:

 - bits 0-13, each word: X component of motion vector for subpartition i.
 - bits 14-25, each word: Y component of motion vector for subpartition i.
 - bits 26-30, word 0, 4, 8, 12: RPI for partition i>>2.
 - bit 26, word 1, 5, 9, 13: zero flag for subpartition i-1
 - bit 27, word 1, 5, 9, 13: zero flag for subpartition i
 - bit 28, word 1, 5, 9, 13: zero flag for subpartition i+1
 - bit 29, word 1, 5, 9, 13: zero flag for subpartition i+2
 - bit 26, word 15: frame/field flag for the macroblock
 - bit 27, word 15: inter/intra flag for the macroblock


= MVSURF_OUT setup =

The MVSURF_OUT has three different output modes:

 - field picture output mode: each write writes one MVSURF macroblock and
   skips one MVSURF macroblock, each line is passed once
 - MBAFF frame picture output mode: each write writes one MVSURF macroblock,
   each line is passed once
 - non-MBAFF frame picture output mode: each write writes one MVSURF
   macroblock and skips one macroblock, each line is passed twice, with first
   pass writing even-numbered macroblocks, second pass writing odd-numbered
   macroblocks

The following registers control MVSURF_OUT behavior:

BAR0 0x1032f0 / XLMI 0x0bc00: MVSURF_OUT_OFFSET [VP2]
  The offset of MVSURF_OUT from the start of the MEMIF MVSURF port. The offset
  is in bytes and has to be divisible by 0x40.

BAR0 0x085490 / I[0x12400]: MVSURF_OUT_ADDR [VP3+]
  The address of MVSURF_OUT in falcon port #2, shifted right by 8 bits.

BAR0 0x1032f4 / XLMI 0x0bd00: MVSURF_OUT_PARM [VP2]
BAR0 0x085494 / I[0x12500]: MVSURF_OUT_PARM [VP3+]
  bits 0-7: WIDTH, length of a single pass in writable macroblocks
  bit 8: MBAFF_FRAME_FLAG, 1 if MBAFF frame picture mode enabled
  bit 9: FIELD_PIC_FLAG, 1 if field picture mode enabled

If neither bit 8 nor 9 is set, non-MBAFF frame picture mode is used. Bit 8 and
bit 9 shouldn't be set at the same time.

BAR0 0x1032f8 / XLMI 0x0be00: MVSURF_OUT_LEFT [VP2]
BAR0 0x085498 / I[0x12600]: MVSURF_OUT_LEFT [VP3+]
  bits 0-7: X, the number of writable macroblocks left in the current pass
  bits 8-15: Y, the number of passes left, including the current pass

BAR0 0x1032fc / XLMI 0x0bf00: MVSURF_OUT_POS [VP2]
BAR0 0x08549c / I[0x12700]: MVSURF_OUT_POS [VP3+]
  bits 0-12: MBADDR, the index of the current macroblock from the start of
    MVSURF.
  bit 13: PASS_ODD, 1 if the current pass is odd-numbered pass

All of these registers are RW by the host. LEFT and POS registers are also
modified by the hardware when it writes macroblocks.

The whole write operation is divided into so-called "passes", which correspond
to a line of macroblocks [field, non-MBAFF frame] or half a line [MBAFF
frame]. When a macroblock is written to the MVSURF, it's written at the
position indicated by POS.MBADDR, LEFT.X is decremented by 1, and POS.MBADDR
is incremented by 1 [MBAFF frame] or 2 [field, non-MBAFF frame]. If this
causes LEFT.X to drop to 0, a new pass is started, as follows:

 - LEFT.X is reset to PARM.WIDTH
 - LEFT.Y is decreased by 1
 - POS.PASS_ODD is flipped
 - if non-MBAFF frame picture mode is in use:
   - if PASS_ODD is 1, POS.MBADDR is decreased by PARM.WIDTH * 2 and bit 0
     is set to 1
   - otherwise [PASS_ODD is 0], POS.MBADDR bit 0 is set to 0

When either LEFT.X or LEFT.Y is 0, writes to MVSURF_OUT are ignored.

The MVSURF_OUT port has an output buffer of about 4 macroblocks - mvswrite
will queue data into that buffer, and it'll auto-flush as MEMIF bandwidth
allows. To determine whether the buffer is full [ie. if it's safe to queue
any more data with mvswrite], use $stat bit 6:

$stat bit 6: MVSURF_OUT buffer full - no more space is available currently
for writes, mvswrite instruction will be ignored and shouldn't be attempted
until this bit drops to 0 [when MEMIF accepts more data].


= MVSURF_IN setup =

The MVSURF_OUT has two input modes:

 - interlaced mode: used for field and MBAFF frame pictures, each read reads
   one macroblock pair, each line is passed once
 - progressive mode: used for non-MBAFF frame pictures, each read reads one
   macroblock pair, each line is passed twice

#===#===#===#
|   |   |   |  interlaced: 0&1, 2&3, 4&5, 6&7, 8&9, 10&11
| 0 | 2 | 4 |
|   |   |   |  progressive: 0&1, 2&3, 4&5, 0&1, 2&3, 4&5, 6&7, 8&9, 10&11, 6&7, 8&9, 10&11

The following registers control MVSURF_IN behavior:

BAR0 0x1032e0 / XLMI 0x0b800: MVSURF_IN_OFFSET [VP2]
  The offset of MVSURF_IN from the start of the MEMIF MVSURF port. The offset
  is in bytes and has to be divisible by 0x40.

BAR0 0x085480 / I[0x12000]: MVSURF_IN_ADDR [VP3+]
  The address of MVSURF_IN in falcon port #2, shifted right by 8 bits.

BAR0 0x1032e4 / XLMI 0x0b900: MVSURF_IN_PARM [VP2]
BAR0 0x085484 / I[0x12100]: MVSURF_IN_PARM [VP3+]
  bits 0-7: WIDTH, length of a single line in macroblock pairs
  bit 8: PROGRESSIVE, 1 if progressive mode enabled, 0 if interlaced mode
    enabled

BAR0 0x1032e8 / XLMI 0x0ba00: MVSURF_IN_LEFT [VP2]
BAR0 0x085488 / I[0x12200]: MVSURF_IN_LEFT [VP3+]
  bits 0-7: X, the number of macroblock pairs left in the current line
  bits 8-15: Y, the number of lines left, including the current line

BAR0 0x1032ec / XLMI 0x0bb00: MVSURF_IN_POS [VP2]
BAR0 0x08548c / I[0x12300]: MVSURF_IN_POS [VP3+]
  bits 0-11: MBPADDR, the index of the current macroblock pair from the start
    of MVSURF.
  bit 12: PASS, 0 for first pass, 1 for second pass

All of these registers are RW by the host. LEFT and POS registers are also
modified by the hardware when it writes macroblocks.

The read operation is divided into lines. In interlaced mode, each line is
read once, in progressive mode each line is read twice. A single read of
a line is called a pass. When a macroblock pair is read, it's read from the
position indicated by POS.MBPADDR, LEFT.X is decremented by 1, and POS.MBPADDR
is incremented by 1. If this causes LEFT.X to drop to 0, a new line or a new
pass over the same line is started:

 - LEFT.X is reset to PARM.WIDTH
 - if progressive mode is in use and POS.PASS is 0:
   - PASS is set to 1
   - POS.MBPADDR is decreased by PARM.WIDTH
 - otherwise [interlaced mode is in use or PASS is 1]:
   - PASS is set to 0
   - LEFT.Y is decremented by 1

When either LEFT.X or LEFT.Y is 0, reads from MVSURF_IN will fail and won't
affect MVSURF_IN registers in any way.

The MVSURF_IN port has an input buffer of 2 macroblock pairs. It will attempt
to fill this buffer as soon as it's possible to read a macroblock pair [ie.
LEFT.X and LEFT.Y are non-0]. For this reason, LEFT must always be the last
register to be written when setting up MVSURF_IN. In addition, this makes it
impossible to seamlessly switch to a new MVSURF_IN buffer without reading the
previous one until the end.

The MVSURF_IN always operates on units of macroblock pairs. This means that
the following special handling is necessary:

 - field pictures: use interlaced mode, execute mvsread for each processed
   macroblock
 - MBAFF frame pictures: use interlaced mode, execute mvsread for each
   processed macroblock pair [when starting to process the first macroblock in
   pair].
 - non-MBAFF frame pictures: use progressive mode, execute mvsread for each
   processed macroblock

In all cases, Care must be taken to use the right macroblock from the pair in
computations.


= MVSO[] address space =

MVSO[] is a write-only memory space consisting of 0x80 16-bit cells. Every
address in range 0-0x7f corresponds to one cell. However, not all cells and
not all bits of each cell are actually used. The usable cells are:

 - MVSO[i * 8 + 0], i in 0..15: X component of motion vector for subpartition i
 - MVSO[i * 8 + 1], i in 0..15: Y component of motion vector for subpartition i
 - MVSO[i * 0x20 + j * 8 + 2], i in 0..3, j in 0..3: RPI of partition i, j is
   ignored
 - MVSO[i * 8 + 3], i in 0..15: the "zero flag" for subpartition i
 - MVSO[i * 0x20 + 4], i in 0..15: macroblock flags, i is ignored:
    - bit 0: frame/field flag
    - bit 1: inter/intra flag
 - MVSO[i * 0x20 + 5], i in 0..15: macroblock partitioning schema, same
   format as $mbpart register, i is ignored [10 bits used]

If the address of some datum has some ignored fields, writing to any two
addresses with only the ignored fields differing will actually access the
same data.


= MVSI[] address space =

MVSI[] is a read-only memory space consisting of 0x100 16-bit cells. Every
address in range 0-0xff corresponds to one cell. The cells are:

 - MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 0], i in 0..15: X component of motion vector for
   subpartition i [sign extended to 16 bits]
 - MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 1], i in 0..15: Y component of motion vector for
   subpartition i [sign extended to 16 bits]
 - MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 0x20 + j * 8 + 2], i in 0..3, j in 0..3: RPI of
   partition i, j is ignored
 - MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 3], i in 0..15: the "zero flag" for subpartition i
 - MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 4 + j], i in 0..15, j in 0..3: macroblock flags,
   i and j are ignored:
    - bit 0: frame/field flag
    - bit 1: inter/intra flag

mb is 0 for the top macroblock in pair, 1 for the bottom macroblock.

If the address of some datum has some ignored fields, all addresses will alias
and read the same datum.

Note that, aside of explicit loads from MVSI[], the MVSI[] data is also
implicitely accessed by some fixed-function vµc hardware to calculate MV
predictors and other values.


= Writing MVSURF: mvswrite =

Data is sent to MVSURF_OUT via the mvswrite instruction. A single invocation
of mvswrite writes a single macroblock. The data is gathered from MVSO[]
space. mvswrite is aware of macroblock partitioning and will use the
partitioning schema to gather data from the right cells of MVSO[] - for
instance, if 16x8 macroblock partitioning is used, only subpartitions 0 and 8
are used, and their data is duplicated for all 8x8/4x4 blocks they cover.

This instruction should not be used if MVSURF_OUT output buffer is currently
full - the code should execute a wstc instruction on $stat bit 6 beforehand.

Note that this instruction takes 17 cycles to gather the data from MVSO[]
space - in that time, MVSO[] contents shouldn't be modified. On cycles 1-16
of execution, $stat bit 7 will be lit up:

$stat bit 7: mvswrite MVSO[] data gathering in progress - this bit is set at
the end of cycle 1 of mvswrite execution, cleared at the end of cycle 17 of
mvswrite execution, ie. when it's safe to modify MVSO[]. Note that this means
that the instruction right after mvswrite will still read 0 in this bit - to
wait for mvswrite completion, use mvswrite; nop; wstc 7 sequence. This bit
going back to 0 doesn't mean that MVSURF write is complete - it merely means
that data has been gathered and queued for a write through the MEMIF.

If execution of this instruction causes the MVSURF_OUT buffer to become full,
bit 6 of $stat is set to 1 on the same cycle as bit 7.

Instructions:
	mvswrite
Opcode: special opcode, OP=01010, OPC=001
Operation:
	b32 tmp[0x10] = { 0 };
	if (MVSURF_OUT.no_space_left())
		break;
	$stat[7] = 1; /* cycle 1 */
	if (MVSURF_OUT.full_after_next_mb())
		$stat[6] = 1;
	b2 partlut[4] = { 0, 2, 1, 3 };
	b10 mbpart = MVSO[5];
	for (i = 0; i < 0x10; i++) {
		pidx = i >> 2;
		pmask = partlut[mbpart & 3];
		spmask = pmask << 2 | partlut[mbpart >> (pidx * 2 + 2) & 3];
		mpidx = pidx & pmask;
		mspidx = i & spmask;
		tmp[i] |= MVSO[mspidx * 8 + 0] | MVSO[mspidx * 8 + 1] << 14;
		tmp[(i & 0xc) | 1] |= MVSO[mspidx * 8 + 3] << (26 + (i & 3));
	}
	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		pidx = i >> 2;
		pmask = partlut[mbpart & 3];
		mpidx = pidx & pmask;
		tmp[i * 4] |= MVSO[mpidx * 0x20 + 2] << 26;
	}
	tmp[0xf] |= MVSO[4] << 26;
	$stat[7] = 0; /* cycle 17 */
	MVSURF_OUT.write(tmp);

        the time needed by MVSURF_OUT to actually flush the data to memory]

= Reading MVSURF: mvsread =

Data is read from MVSURF_IN via the mvsread instruction. A single invocation
of mvsread reads a single macroblock pair. The data is storred into MVSI[]
space.

Since MVSURF resides in VRAM, which doesn't have a deterministic access time,
this instruction may take an arbitrarily long time to complete the read. The
read is done asynchronously and a $stat bit is provided to let the microcode
know when it's finished:

$stat bit 5: mvsread MVSI[] write done - this bit is cleared on cycle 1 of
mvsread execution and set by the mvsread instruction once data for a complete
macroblock pair has been read and stored into MVSI[]. Note that this means
that the instruction right after mvsread may stil read 1 in this bit - to wait
for mvsread completion, use mvsread ; nop ; wsts 5 sequence. Also note that
if the read fails because one of MVSURF_IN_LEFT fields is 0, this bit will
never become 1. Also, note that the initial state of this bit after vµc reset
is 0, even though no mvsread execution is in progress.

Instructions:
	mvsread
Opcode: special opcode, OP=01001, OPC=001
Operation:
	b32 tmp[2][0x10];
	$stat[5] = 0; /* cycle 1 */
	MVSURF_IN.read(tmp); /* arbitrarily long */
	for (mb = 0; mb < 2; mb++) {
		for (i = 0; i < 0x10; i++) {
			MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 0] = SEX(tmp[mb][i][0:13]);
			MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 1] = SEX(tmp[mb][i][14:25]);
			MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 2] = tmp[mb][i&0xc][26:30];
			MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 3] = tmp[mb][(i&0xc) | 1][26 + (i & 3)];
			MVSI[mb * 0x80 + i * 8 + 4] = tmp[mb][15][26:27];
