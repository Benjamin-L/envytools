= Introduction =

Every falcon engine has an associated IO space. The space consists of 32-bit IO
registers, and is accessible in two ways:

 - host access by MMIO areas in BAR0
 - falcon access by io* instructions

The IO space contains control registers for the microprocessor itself,
interrupt and timer setup, code/data space access ports, PFIFO communication
registers, as well as registers for the engine-specific hardware that falcon
is meant to control.

The addresses are different between falcon and host. From falcon POV, the IO space
is word-addressable 0x40000-byte space. However, most registers are duplicated
64 times: bits 2-7 of the address are ignored. The few registers that don't
ignore these bits are called "indexed" registers. From host POV, the falcon IO
space is a 0x1000-byte window in BAR0. Its base address is engine-dependent.
First 0xf00 bytes of this window are tied to the falcon IO space, while last 0x100
bytes contain several host-only registers. On nva3-d9, host mmio address
falcon_base + X is directed to falcon IO space address X << 6 | HOST_IO_INDEX << 2.
On nvd9+, some engines stopped using the indexed accesses. On those,
host mmio address falcon_base + X is directed to falcon IO space address X.
HOST_IO_INDEX is specified in the host-only MMIO register falcon_base + 0xffc:

MMIO 0xffc: HOST_IO_INDEX
  bits 0-5: selects bits 2-7 of the falcon IO space when accessed from host.

Unaligned accesses to the IO space are unsupported, both from host and falcon.
Low 2 bits of addresses should be 0 at all times.

The host MMIO base addresses for various engines are:

PBSP			084000
PVP			085000
PPPP			086000
PCRYPT			087000
PCOPY[0]		104000
PCOPY[1]		105000
PDAEMON			10a000
PVCOMP			1c1000
PGRAPH.CTXCTL		409000
PGRAPH.TP[i].CTXCTL	502000 + i * 0x8000

+ means v3+ only register.
* means v4+ only register
S means secret register. [see falcon/crypt.txt]

= Scratch registers =

MMIO 0x040 / I[0x01000]: SCRATCH0
MMIO 0x044 / I[0x01100]: SCRATCH1
MMIO 0x080 / I[0x02000]: SCRATCH2
MMIO 0x084 / I[0x02100]: SCRATCH3
  Scratch 32-bit registers, meant for host <-> falcon communication.


= Engine status and control registers =

MMIO 0x04c / I[0x01300]: STATUS
  Status of various parts of the engine. For each bit, 1 means busy, 0 means
  idle.
  bit 0: UC. Microcode. 1 if microcode is running and not on a sleep insn.
  bit 1: ???
  Further bits are engine-specific.

MMIO 0x05c / I[0x01700]: STATUS_MASK
  A bitmask of nonexistent status bits. Each of bits 0-15 is set to 0 if
  corresponding STATUS line is tied to anything in this particular engine, 1
  if it's unused. [?]

MMIO 0x07c / I[0x01f00]: SUBENGINE_RESET
  When written with value 1, resets all subengines that this falcon engine
  controls - that is, everything in IO space addresses 0x10000:0x20000. Note
  that this includes the memory interface - using this register while an xfer
  is in progress is ill-advised.


= PCOUNTER signal control registers =

MMIO 0x088 / I[0x02200]: MISC_TRIGGER
  A WO "trigger" register for various things. write 1 to a bit to trigger
  the relevant event, 0 to do nothing.
  bits 0-15: ??? [perf counters?]
  bit 16: WRCACHE_FLUSH
  bit 17: ??? [PM_TRIGGER?]


= v0 code/data upload registers =

MMIO 0xff4: UPLOAD
  The data to upload, see below
MMIO 0xff8: UPLOAD_ADDR
  bits 2-15: bits 2-15 of the code/data address being uploaded.
  bit 20: target segment. 0 means data, 1 means code.
  bit 21: readback.
  bit 24: xfer busy [RO]
  bit 28: secret flag - secret engines only [see falcon/crypt.txt]
  bit 29: code busy [RO]

This pair of registers can be used on v0 to read/write code and data
segments. It's quite fragile and should only be used when no xfers are active.
bit 24 of UPLOAD_ADDR is set when this is the case. On v3+, this pair is
broken and should be avoided in favor of the new-style access via CODE and
DATA ports [see falcon/vm.txt and falcon/data.txt].

To write data, poke address to UPLOAD_ADDR, then poke the data words to
UPLOAD. The address will auto-increment as words are uploaded.

To read data or code, poke address + readback flag to UPLOAD_ADDR, then read
the word from UPLOAD. This only works for a single word, and you need to poke
UPLOAD_ADDR again for each subsequent word.

The code segment is organised in 0x100-byte pages. On secretful engines, each
page can be secret or not. Reading from secret pages doesn't work and you just
get 0. Writing code segment can only be done in aligned page units.

To write a code page, write start address of the page + secret flag [if
needed] to UPLOAD_ADDR, then poke multiple of 0x40 words to UPLOAD. The
address will autoincrement. The process cannot be interrupted except between
pages. The "code busy" flag in UPLOAD_ADDR will be lit when this is the case.

= IO space writes: iowr, iowrs =

Writes a word to IO space. iowr does asynchronous writes [queues the write,
but doesn't wait for completion], iowrs does synchronous write [write is
guaranteed to complete before executing next instruction]. On v0 cards,
iowrs doesn't exist and synchronisation can instead be done by re-reading
the relevant register.

	iowr - Asynchronous IO space write	subopcode = 0
	iowrs - Synchronous IO space write	subopcode = 1 [v3+ only]
