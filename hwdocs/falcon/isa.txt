Registers

There are 16 32-bit GPRs, $r0-$r15. There are also a dozen or so special
registers:

num | type | name      | description
-------------------------------------
 0  |  T   | $iv0      | interrupt 0 vector
 1  |  T   | $iv1      | interrupt 1 vector
 3  |  T   | $tv       | trap vector
 4  |  D   | $sp       | stack pointer
 5  |  B   | $pc       | program counter
 6  |  X   | $xcbase   | code xfer external base
 7  |  X   | $xdbase   | data xfer external base
 8  |  AT  | $flags    | misc flags
 9  |  S   | $cx       | crypt xfer mode
 a  |  S   | $cauth    | crypt auth code selection
 b  |  X   | $xtargets | xfer port selection
 c  |  T3  | $tstatus  | trap status

$flags is split into the following bitfields:

 num | type | name    | description
------------------------------------
 0-7 |  A   | $p0-$p7 | general-purpose predicates
  8  |  A   | c       | carry flag
  9  |  A   | o       | signed overflow flag
  a  |  A   | s       | sign/negative flag
  b  |  A   | z       | zero flag
 10  |  T   | ie0     | interrupt 0 enable
 11  |  T   | ie1     | interrupt 1 enable
 12  |  ?4  | unk12   | ??? [XXX]
 14  |  T   | is0     | interrupt 0 saved enable
 15  |  T   | is1     | interrupt 1 saved enable
 16  |  ?4  | unk16   | ??? [XXX]
 18  |  T   | ta      | trap handler active
1a-1c|  ?4  | unk1a   | ??? [XXX]
1d-1f|  ?4  | unk1d   | ??? [XXX]


Instruction formats

Instructions have 2, 3, or 4 bytes. First byte of instruction determines its
length and format. High 2 bits of the first byte determine the instruction's
operand size; 00 means 8-bit, 01 means 16-bit, 10 means 32-bit, and 11 means
an instruction that doesn't use operand sizing. The set of available opcodes
varies greatly with the instruction format.

O1: opcode goes to low 4 bits of byte 0
O2: opcode goes to low 4 bits of byte 1
OL: opcode goes to low 6 bits of byte 1
O3: opcode goes to low 4 bits of byte 2

R1x: register encoded in low 4 bits of byte 1
R2x: register encoded in high 4 bits of byte 1
R3x: register encoded in high 4 bits of byte 2
RxS: register used as source
RxD: register used as destination
RxSD: register used as both source and destination
I8: 8-bit immediate encoded in byte 2
I16: 16-bit immediate encoded in bytes 2 and 3

Code segment

falcon has separate code and data spaces. Code segment, like data segment, is
located in small piece of SRAM in the microcontroller. Its size can be
determined by looking at MMIO address falcon+0x108, bits 0-8 shifted left by 8.

Code is byte-oriented, but can only be accessed by 32-bit words from outside,
and can only be modified in 0x100-byte [page] units.

On pre-NVA3, code segment is just a flat piece of RAM, except for the per-page
secret flag. See falcon/io.txt for information on uploading code and data.

On NVA3+, code segment is paged with virtual -> physical translation and needs
special handling. See falcon/vm.txt for details.

Code execution is started by host via MMIO from arbitrary entry point, and is
stopped either by host or by the microcode itself, see falcon/proc.txt

When an invalid opcode is hit, $pc is unmodified and a trap is generated. On
NVA3+, $tstatus reason field is set to 8. Pre-NVA3 cards don't have $tstatus
register, but this is the only trap type they support anyway.
